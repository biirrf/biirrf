💼 I currently work at Tuckers Solicitors, where I support legal operations and am exploring the intersection between law and technology.  
🛠️ I’m building projects to improve everyday processes, with a focus on web apps, automation, and data tools.  
📈 I'm actively learning Python, JavaScript, and cloud tools to prepare for a tech career in the UK.
